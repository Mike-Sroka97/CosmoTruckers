{{5}}Wowza! That sure was <anim:wave>scary!</anim>
{{5}}Thanks for saving me, y'all!
{{5}}Who <i>knows</i> what would’a happened if I was in there longer?
{{5}}I could kind of feel myself...<p:short> slipping away. Weird, huh? 
{{3}}Ominous!
{{5}}Oh don't worry, I'm all good now! 
{{4}}Olaris said that you might know something about Qmuav and a powerful item? 
{{4}{animWait:4,hype}}C’mon! We’re dying to know!
{{5}{animDefault:4,smug}}Well, daddy might’ve been fibbing just a <anim:wave>little</anim> bit on that one. 
{{5}}I’ve never heard of some powerful item. 
{{4}{animWait:4,hype}}...<p:long><size=250%><anim:shake>HUH?!?</anim>
{{5}}Now hold on with the angry face! 
{{5}}I've can still help y'all out! 
{{5}{animDefault:4,smug}}While I was going through Constellation Cavern, I finally found it!
{{5}{animDefault:4,smug}}The last gem for Klippsol’s bridge! 
{{3}}Wow! Great job! 
{{3}}I'm not sure how that helps us!
{{5}}Daddy's guess is probably spot on. If something powerful is here, it's with Qmuav. 
{{5}}But to get to him, we'll need some help. 
{{5}}The old asteroid belt leading to Qmuav was ruined. But if anyone can fix it, Klippsol can! 
{{5}}He's got all sorts of tricks up his sleeve! 
{{5}}You'll just have to find him in his cove and ask! But I'm sure he'll help!<p:short><size=50%> ...Probably. 
{{2}}Let's do it! 
{{1}}Well, at least it's progress. Thanks, Loona. 
{{5}}Oh, and one last thing! 
{{5}}If you need any help with Klippsol, make sure to swing by Klepter's!   
{{5}}He's the one who made him, after all. 
{{1}}Well, at least it's progress. Thanks, Loona. 
{{5}}Good luck, y'all!
