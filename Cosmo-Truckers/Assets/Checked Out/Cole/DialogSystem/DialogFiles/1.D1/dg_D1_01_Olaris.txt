{{5}}<anim:shake>GAH!</anim> 
{{5}{animWait:5,confused}}Is...<p:normal>is someone there? 
{{1}}...<p:short>Yes? There's four of us. 
{{5}{animWait:5,squint}}...Oh. So there are! 
{{5}}Eyesight's not what it used to be, darn nova cataracts.  
{{5}}Anyhoo, hello there! Can’t say I’ve ever seen you fellas before. 
{{5}}You don't look like Novas either. Always a pleasure to meet new folks! 
{{3}}Wow! You’re old! 
{{2}}Really? 
{{5}}<anim:wave>Hahaha!</anim> Can’t say you’re wrong. I’m Olaris. What can I do for y’all? 
{{5}}Come to Nova’s Landing for a little getaway? Not a great time for it, sadly. 
{{4}}Actually, we’re all here on business, looking for a powerful magic item.  
{{4}{animWait:4,money}}You wouldn’t happen to HAVE that, would you?
{{5}Hmmm. Powerful item, you say? 
{{5}...Hmm...
{{5}...Hmm...mm...
{{5}...
{{5}<anim:wave>...zZz...</anim>
{{2}Um, hello? Sir? 
{{2}<anim:shake>GAH!?!</anim> 
{{1}The item? 
{{5}Right, right. <i>Ahem.</i> Sorry 'bout that. 
{{5}Can't say I do. Maybe Qmuav has something like that...
{{4}Qmuav?
{{5}You fellas don't know Qmuav, the black hole?
{{5}He's what made Gloom-Gloom Galaxy the way it is! What a nasty fella!
{{5}Qmauv might have what you're lookin' for, but getting to him won't be a walk in the cosmos.  
{{5}If anyone could help you get there, my daughter Loona could!   
{{2}Cool. Where's she at? The pink house?  
{{5}No, she's...She’s been missing in Gloom-Gloom Galaxy for a while now. 
{{5}Last I recall, she was going to explore Constellation Cavern. 
{{5}You fellas need that item, right? 
{{5}If you can find her, I'm certain she can help! 
{{1}Sounds like our best shot. 
{{2}Let's do it!  
{{5}Thanks, lads. Here. I’ll give you a ticket to Yed’s Train Station. 
{{5}Yed will help y’all get into Gloom-Gloom Galaxy and the Cavern. From there, it’s up to you. 
{{5}Please, bring my Loona back to me. 
{{3}Let’s hope so!
