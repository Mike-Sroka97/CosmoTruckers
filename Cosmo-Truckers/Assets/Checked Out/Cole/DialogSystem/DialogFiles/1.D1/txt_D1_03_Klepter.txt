{{3}}Hellloooooo? Anybody home? 
{{5}}Well well well. I’ve been <i>expecting</i> you four.  
{{5}}Loona said you may have need of my expertise with Klippsol.  
{{5}}I must say, I have <anim:wave>eagerly</anim> awaited this moment.   
{{5}}Finally! The skills of the <anim:shake>GREAT</anim> and <anim:shake>BRILLIANT</anim> scientist, Klepter, are needed!    
{{5}}Let us make haste! How can my <anim:shake>GENIUS</anim> be of assistance?   
{{1}}Open this bag. 
{{5}}<p:long>You need me...To open this bag?  
{{4}}Yep. 
{{5}}A-And there's nothing else? 
{{1}}Nope. Just the bag.
{{5}}I-I see. It must be magic of some sort. Unopenable, was it? 
{{3}}We didn’t even try!
{{5}}You...Pardon me? 
{{3}}I said we didn’t try! <anim:shake>OPEN THE BAG!</anim>
{{5}}...<p:normal>Alright. I suppose I said I would help. Here it goes.  
{{2}}Uhh, is that a dog? 
{{5}}I-I’m not certain. You there! Are you a Dog? 
{{6}}Arf!  
{{5}}Statistically speaking, that’s not necessarily a <i>yes</i>.  
{{1}}How does this help us? 
{{5}}I haven’t the faintest clue.  
{{5}}However! If Klippsol gave it to you, then this <b>creature</b> must be of <i>some</i> help.  
{{4}}So, what? We just bring it to the broken asteroid belt and hope for the best? 
{{5}}<sp:15>Yeeees. <sp:20>Yes. That’s really all you can do.  
{{4}}<p:normal>Okay. Let’s go, everyone. You too, dog.  
{{6}}Gorp!
