<sp:25>Alright, Safe-T, let's explain your movement system! 
<sp:25>Safe-T can move left and right, and attack up, left, and right. 
<sp:25>Safe-T also has a chargeable jump!
<sp:25>When charging up your jump, you must be on the ground, and you cannot move!  
<sp:25>Don't worry, when you're charing your jump, you'll be invincible!   
<sp:25>Safe-T's special is his spin dash! This will move Safe-T horizontally and give him invincibility!  
<sp:25>Safe-T has a reoccuring character, Risk-E, in his minigames. 
<sp:25>The mech you see above is Gonzor, one of Risk-E's dangerous machines!  
<sp:25>Use Gonzor's hands to climb and destroy the mech's weak points!
