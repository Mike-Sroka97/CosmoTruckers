<sp:25>You've entered into an enemy minigame! 
<sp:25>Proto, you'll be the crew member defending this minigame!  
<sp:25>While this attack <i>was</i> directed at you, Proto, sometimes enemies will cast spells at other enemies. 
<sp:25>When this happens, one of the crew members will still intercept the minigame to determine how well the spell is cast! 
<sp:25>The objective of this minigame is to avoid getting hit by the club or its shockwaves! 
<sp:25>As you can see, there are no success outlined objects. 
<sp:25>Many enemy minigames will determine your score by the number of hits you take, or how long you can survive!   
<sp:25>Try not to get hit!
