<sp:25>Six-Face, we're going to have you cast Petty Theft! 
<sp:25>Before we do, let's take a moment to discuss your mana system. 
<sp:25>Unlike some crew members, Six-Face, you don't have a depleting resource. 
<sp:25>Instead, you alternate between six unique faces.  
<sp:25>These faces are <color:purple>Smug</color>, <color:orange>Money</color>, <color:green>Dizzy</color>, <color:magenta>Hype</color>, <color:blue>Sad</color>, and <color:gray>Megalomaniac</color>.
<sp:25>You always start off combat in the <color:purple>Smug</color> face. 
<sp:25>After you cast one of your spells, you will be given a new face. 
<sp:25>Some spells will have different outcomes, depending on which face you are in. 
<sp:25>When a spell has No Target as its targeting, you'll need to be in the <color:orange>Money</color> face to target a specific character. 
<sp:25>If you cast a No Target spell while <color:green>Dizzy</color>, you'll target a random character instead. 
<sp:25>While in the <color:magenta>Hype</color> face, you'll give the targeted enemies extra stacks of an important debuff called Subduction, if they have it. 
<sp:25>And if you use a move that gives Subduction while in the <color:blue>Sad</color> face, enemies won't receive <i>any</i> of the debuff. 
<sp:25>Each time you have a face, you <b>gain</b> that face on your character vessel below.   
<sp:25>Right now, the only face you have is Smug.   
<sp:25>If you gain all 5 faces, you go into <color:gray>Megalomaniac</color> mode.  
<sp:25>This mode lasts for one turn. Certain spells use this to transform from a normal spell into an extremely powerful one! 
<sp:25>After using it, you'll have to gain all the faces again! 
<sp:25>With that out of the way, let's cast Petty Theft on the bottom enemy!
