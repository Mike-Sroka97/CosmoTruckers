<sp:25>Six-Face, we're going to have you cast Petty Theft! 
<sp:25>Before we do, let's take a moment to dive in to your mana system. 
<sp:25>Unlike some crew members, Six-Face doesn't have a depleting resource. 
<sp:25>Instead, Six-Face alternates between six unique faces.  
<sp:25>These faces are <color:145,83,163,1>Smug</color>, <color:235,148,101,1>Money</color>, <color:93,153,92,1>Dizzy</color>, <color:212,76,121,1>Hype</color>, <color:114,127,181,1>Sad</color>, and <color:189,157,157,1>Megalomaniac</color>.
<sp:25>Six-Face always starts off in <color:145,83,163,1>Smug</color>. 
<sp:25>After you cast one of Six-Face's spells, you will be given a new face. 
<sp:25>Some spells will have different outcomes depending on which face you are in. 
<sp:25>When a spell has "No Target" as its targeting, Six-Face will need to be in <color:235,148,101,1>Money</color> face to target a specific character. 
<sp:25>If Six-Face casts a No Target spell while <color:93,153,92,1>Dizzy</color>, he will target a random target. 
<sp:25>While in <color:212,76,121,1>Hype</color> face, he will give the targeted enemies extra stacks of an important debuff called Subduction if they have it. 
<sp:25>And if he uses a move that gives Subduction while in <color:114,127,181,1>Sad</color> face, enemies won't receive any of the debuff. 
<sp:25>Each time you have a face, you gain that face.  
<sp:25>If you gain all 5 faces, you go into Megalomaniac mode.  
<sp:25>This mode lasts for one turn. Certain spells use this to transform from a normal spell into an extremely powerful one! 
<sp:25>With that out of the way, let's have Six-Face cast Petty Theft on the bottom enemy!
