<sp:25>Nice work, Safe-T! 
<sp:25>Now's a good time to quickly explain Strength! 
<sp:25>For you, Safe-T, Strength is a key augment that you'll get after defeating an enemy. 
<sp:25>For every enemy that you deal the finishing blow to, you'll get one stack of Strength!  
<sp:25>Each stack of Strength makes your attacks do even more damage!   
<sp:25>Most crew members have their own unique augments, so try to keep them in mind!
