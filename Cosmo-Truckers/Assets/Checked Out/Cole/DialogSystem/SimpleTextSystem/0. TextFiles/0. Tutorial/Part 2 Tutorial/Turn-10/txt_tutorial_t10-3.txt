<sp:25>Nice work, Safe-T! 
<sp:25>Now's a good time to quickly explain Strength! 
<sp:25>Strength is a key augment that Safe-T gets when he defeats an enemy. 
<sp:25>For every enemy that he deals the finishing blow to, he gets one stack of Strength!  
<sp:25>Each stack of Strength makes Safe-T's attacks do even more damage!   
<sp:25>Most crew members have unique augments to them, so try to keep them in mind!
