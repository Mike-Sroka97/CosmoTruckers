<sp:25>Let's take a moment to explain your mana system, Safe-T. 
<sp:25>Your mana is all about hitting enemies and getting hit!  
<sp:25>Each time you receive or dish out an instance of damage, you get one Ang-R! 
<sp:25>Ang-R is shown by the Rage slots by your character vessel below! 
<sp:25>Three Ang-R equals one Rage, and the color of the Rage Bars will change! 
<sp:25>Rage is what can be used to cast spells.

<sp:25>You has a max of three Rage.
