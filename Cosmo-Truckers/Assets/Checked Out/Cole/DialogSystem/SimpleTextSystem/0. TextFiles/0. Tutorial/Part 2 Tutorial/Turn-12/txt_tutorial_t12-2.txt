<sp:25>Aeglar, we'll have you use Veggie Vengeance once more!
<sp:25>This time, we're going to explain its secondary effect! 
<sp:25>When Veggie Vengeance tries to heal a target with more incoming health than they're missing, something interesting happens!
<sp:25>Any health that wasn't used will turn into damage! 
<sp:25>So, if you target a character with <anim:wave>full health</anim>, it will only do damage, not healing!  
<sp:25>Even <anim:shake>crazier</anim>, you can actually do this to crew members and yourself!  
<sp:25>Let's give it a try, Aeglar. Target yourself!
