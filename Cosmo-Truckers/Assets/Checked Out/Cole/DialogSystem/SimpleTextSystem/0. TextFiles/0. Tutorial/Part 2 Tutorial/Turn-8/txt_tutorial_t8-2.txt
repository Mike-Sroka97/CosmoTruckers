<sp:25>This turn, we're going to have you cast Spark Shield! 
<sp:25>Now is a great time to explain <color:bluelight>Shield health!</color> 
<sp:25>Shield health is another form of health that characters can have! 
<sp:25>When incoming damage hits a character, it will first target Shield health before regular health! 
<sp:25>If the Shield health cannot block all incoming damage, the remaining will target regular health! 
<sp:25>Spark Shield is a self-targeting spell, so target yourself and let's gain some shield!
