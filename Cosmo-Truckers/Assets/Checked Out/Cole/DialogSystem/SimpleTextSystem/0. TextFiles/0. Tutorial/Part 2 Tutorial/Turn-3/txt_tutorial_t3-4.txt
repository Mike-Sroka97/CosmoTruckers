<sp:25>Six-Face, let's explain your movement and a key part of your minigames. 
<sp:25>Just like Proto, you can move left, right, and jump in the air. 
<sp:25>However! When you're airborne, use the jump input again to slow your fall!
<sp:25>You can attack left, right, up, and <i>also</i> down. 
<sp:25>Your down attack is special! When you uses it, you'll get a jet boost upwards! 
<sp:25>You only get one boost, until you touch the ground again! 
<sp:25>Your minigames will also feature fans! 
<sp:25>You can use your slow-fall to fly upwards with the wind! 
<sp:25>In this minigame, you'll need to destroy all the eyes first, and then grab the money inside! 
<sp:25>Give it a whirl!
