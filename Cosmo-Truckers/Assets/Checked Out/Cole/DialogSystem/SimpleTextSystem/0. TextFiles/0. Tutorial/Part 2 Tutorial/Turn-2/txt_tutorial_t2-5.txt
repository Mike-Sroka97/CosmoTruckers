<sp:25>This is one of Proto's minigames!
<sp:25>Proto, you also move in your own unique way, so let's dive into it! 
<sp:25>You can move left and right, but you can also jump! 
<sp:25>You can also attack in the left, right, and up directions. 
<sp:25>Your most unique feature however is your <anim:wave>teleport</anim>. 
<sp:25>By holding down the Ability Button, you can choose a direction to teleport in, shown by a special teleport indicator! 
<sp:25>Using your directional buttons, you can select one of eight directions. 
<sp:25>While choosing a teleport direction, Proto can't move! 
<sp:25>Finally, when you release the Ability Button, you will disappear and reappear at the spot of the indicator! 
<sp:25>Let's also go over Minigame Colors. 
<sp:25>Anything interactable in a minigame will all have a colored outline. 
<sp:25>Every outline color has a meaning! Let's quickly go over each color! 
<sp:25>If the outline is <color:neonred>red</color>, it can stun you, or even instantly end the minigame!
<sp:25>If the outline is <color:green>green</color>, it means that it is tied to success for the minigame! 
<sp:25>If the outline is flashing between <color:neonwhite>white</color> and a solid color, that means it can be attacked! 
<sp:25>But if the outline is <color:neonwhite>solid white</color>, that means it's invincbile, or can't be interacted with! 
<sp:25>If the outline is <color:neonyellow>yellow</color>, it can be toggled on or off! 
<sp:25>Finally, when the outline turns <color:neonorange>orange</color>, it is in a toggled or selected state. 
<sp:25>In this minigame, you need to hit the orbs one at a time, and then hit the center. 
<sp:25>You'll notice that the orb you attacked will be toggled!  
<sp:25>Give it a try!
