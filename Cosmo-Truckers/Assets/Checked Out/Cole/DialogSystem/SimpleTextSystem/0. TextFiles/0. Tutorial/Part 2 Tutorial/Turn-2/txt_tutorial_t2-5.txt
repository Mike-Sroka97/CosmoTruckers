<sp:25>This is one of Proto's minigames!
<sp:25>Just like for Aeglar, let's explain your movement and abilities Proto! 
<sp:25>Proto can move left and right, but Proto can also jump! 
<sp:25>His most unique feature however is his teleport. 
<sp:25>By holding down the Ability Button, Proto can choose a direction to teleport in, shown by a special teleport indicator! 
<sp:25>Using your directional buttons, you can select one of eight directions. 
<sp:25>While choosing a teleport direction, Proto can't move! 
<sp:25>Finally, when you release the Ability Button, Proto will disappear and reappear at the spot of the indicator! 
<sp:25>Before we start, let's quickly go over Minigame Colors. 
<sp:25>Anything interactable in a minigame will all have a colored outline. 
<sp:25>Colors are important indicators for what things do in a Minigame! Let's quickly go over each color! 
<sp:25>If the outline is red, it can stun you, or even instantly end the minigame!
<sp:25>If the outline is green, it means that it is tied to success points for the minigame! 
<sp:25>If the outline is flashing between white and a solid color, that means it can be attacked! 
<sp:25>But if the outline is solid white, that means it's invincbile, or can't be interacted with! 
<sp:25>If the outline is yellow, it can be toggled on or off! 
<sp:25>When the outline turns orange, it is in a toggled or selected state. 
<sp:25>And finally, anything with a black outline can be collided with! 
<sp:25>In this minigame, you need to hit the orbs one at a time, and then hit the center. 
<sp:25>You'll notice that the orb you attacked will be toggled!  
<sp:25>Give it a try!
