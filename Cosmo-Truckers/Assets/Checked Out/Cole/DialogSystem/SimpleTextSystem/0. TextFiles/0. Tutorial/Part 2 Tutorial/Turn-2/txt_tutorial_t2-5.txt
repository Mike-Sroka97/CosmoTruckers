<sp:25>This is one of Proto's minigames!
<sp:25>Just like for Aeglar, let's explain your movement and abilities Proto! 
<sp:25>Proto can move left and right, but Proto can also jump! 
<sp:25>His most unique feature however is his teleport. 
<sp:25>By holding down the Ability Button, Proto can choose a direction to teleport in, shown by a special teleport indicator! 
<sp:25>Using your directional buttons, you can select one of eight directions. 
<sp:25>While choosing a teleport direction, Proto can't move! 
<sp:25>Finally, when you release the Ability Button, Proto will disappear and reappear at the spot of the indicator! 
<sp:25>Before we start, let's quickly go over Minigame Colors.
