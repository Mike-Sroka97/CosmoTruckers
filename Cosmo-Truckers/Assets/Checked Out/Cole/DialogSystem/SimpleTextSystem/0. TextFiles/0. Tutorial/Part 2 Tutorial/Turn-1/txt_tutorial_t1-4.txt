<sp:25>This is a minigame!
<sp:25>Each minigame is different, and so is each crew member!
<sp:25>Every crew member has their own movement, attacks, and abilities. 
<sp:25>Let's not get too complicated for now.
<sp:25>Aeglar, you're up, so we'll explain your movement! 
<sp:25>All crew members can walk left and right. 
<sp:25>Where you differ, Aeglar, is in your ability. 
<sp:25>Some crew members can jump and attack, but you can dash. 
<sp:25>When you hold a direction other than down and then attack or jump, you'll dash towards that direction! 
<sp:25>You can dash twice before touching the ground, and your dashes count as an attack! 
<sp:25>In this minigame, you need to push all the space pigs into the pit for full success. 
<sp:25>Let's give it a try!
