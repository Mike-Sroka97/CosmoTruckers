<sp:25>Hey there, truckers!
<sp:25>It's me, <anim:wave><color:lightpurple>INA!</color></anim> Your Internal Navigation Assistant! 
<sp:25>Looks like you're all in a real nasty situation!
<sp:25>If you don't beat those goons, you're probably going to bite it! 
<sp:25>Especially since they're from the <anim:shake>Galavoid Coalition!</anim>
<sp:25>Fortunately for you, I'm here to help you through your first combat! 
<sp:25>Let's go! Aeglar, you're starting! 
<sp:25>As a crew member, you have three basic options in combat.    
<sp:25>Taking Action, Checking Augments, and Checking Insight.    
<sp:25>Aeglar, you're going to Take Action!
