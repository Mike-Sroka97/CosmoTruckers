  AttackDescription: 'Cost: 0 Charge - Single Target

    Proto needs to charge up
    his attack by hitting the roaming charge. He needs to avoid the electric fields
    that pop up

    The more times Proto charged up by attacking the roaming charge,
    the more damage he will deal to his target. If Proto had zero charges when casting
    this, it will replenish a small amount of charge as well.'
