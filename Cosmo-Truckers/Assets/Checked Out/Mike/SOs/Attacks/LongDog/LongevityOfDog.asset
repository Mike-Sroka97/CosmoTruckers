  AttackDescription: 'Cost: 0 Bullet - Single Target

    Long Dog will need to observe
    the shape presented in the middle of INA and build the shape by stretching into
    the shapes around the edges of the screen.

    The more shapes Long Dog touches,
    without touching an incorrect shape, will increase the stacks of Longevity your
    target will receive.

    Longevity gives healing at the start of that characters
    turn and gives that player increased move speed while in INA.'
