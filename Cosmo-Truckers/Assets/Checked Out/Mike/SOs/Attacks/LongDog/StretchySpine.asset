  AttackDescription: 'Cost: 0 Bullet - No Target

    Long Dog will need to protect
    big Long Dog by blocking dangerous red bullets with his neck and not blocking
    the savory green bullets.

    Long Dogs score will be determined by the number
    of good bullets eaten minus the number of bad bullets eaten. The higher this
    score, the more shields Long Dog will receive.

    Long Dog will also stretch
    his way in front of all party members for a round blocking damage for them. This
    will kill and summons in the player summon area.'
