  AttackDescription: "Tralaxy is weeping for its fallen babies. Evade getting crushed
    by the spirit arm and avoid the ghostly Astrons that will circle you and fire
    at you periodically. \r\n\r\nTralaxy will give the crew member stacks of Sorrow
    equal to their current stacks of Sin, as well as additional stacks of Depression.
    The longer the player survives, the less Depression they receive. \r"
