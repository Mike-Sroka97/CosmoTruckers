  AttackDescription: "Meat Tonguer has gotten its tongue around you. Prepare for
    a solid slurping. Avoid touching its teeth or the dripping saliva, and be sure
    to watch out for its tongue in the middle! \r\n\r\nMeat Tonguer targets an enemy
    ally with this spell, removing all their debuffs and placing them on itself while
    also healing its target. Surviving longer will decrease the healing given. \r"
