  AttackDescription: 'Walking noise is making all sorts of ear-rending sounds. Avoid
    the crew-tracking noise while being mindful of the harmful sporadic noise appearing
    around the targeted crew member.

    

    Evading the noise will reduce the
    amount of damage the targeted crew member receives as well as reducing the number
    of stacks of Noise received.
