  AttackDescription: "Wyingdreem has found a crew member with a great deal of Nitemare
    and swallowed them whole. Attack its heart while navigating the alternating platforms.
    \r\n\r\nWyingdreem will heal itself and give the target stacks of Nitemare, but
    hurting its heart will decrease these. When this spell is finished casting, the
    crew member will be executed. \n"
